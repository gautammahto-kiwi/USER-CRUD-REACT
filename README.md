# React.js User CRUD Application

This project is a React.js application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data, leveraging an external API.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new users to the system.
- **Read**: View the list of existing users.
- **Update**: Modify information of existing users.
- **Delete**: Remove users from the system.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Bootstrap: A front-end framework for designing responsive and mobile-first websites.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-user-crud
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

5. Add the API base URL to the `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://your-api-base-url.com
   ```

   Replace `http://your-api-base-url.com` with the actual base URL of your API.

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- **View Users**: Upon launching the application, you will see a list of existing users.
- **Add User**: Click on the "Add User" button to create a new user. Fill in the required details and click "Save".
- **Edit User**: Click on the "Edit" button next to a user's information to modify their details. After making changes, click "Save" to update the user.
- **Delete User**: Click on the "Delete" button next to a user's information to remove them from the system.

## API Setup

Ensure that the API is running and accessible before using the React application. The API base URL should be configured in the `.env` file as explained above.
